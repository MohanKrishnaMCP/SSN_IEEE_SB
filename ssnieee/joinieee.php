<img src="ieee3.png"><br><br>
  
     Click on Join as student.<br><br>
<br><br>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Step 4</p>

<img src="ieee4.png">
<br><br><br>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Step 5</p>
Click on create account.<br><br><br>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Step 6</p>
Now you will be taken to another page and you will be prompted to fill out basic contact information. Fill it out correctly and provide a good password.
<br>
<img src="ieee5.png"><br><br><br>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Step 7</p>
Once you have filled the above details you will have to click on create account and Continue joining. <br>
    You will then be taken to a new page where you will fill another set of personal information questions that can be saved.
    Save the details and then proceed to the set of options below.<br>
<br>
<img src="ieee6.png"><br>
     Here you will have to make sure only the second dot is filled for " professional or student".<br>
     The University name has to be <b>' Sri Sivasubramaniya Nadar College of Engineering'</b>. <br>
     Regarding Accreditation fill in YES.<br>
     Save after filling in the details.<br>
<br><br>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Step 8</p>
Now move onto the next section and you will find that you can buy subscriptions for different societies and chapters. These are the specific branches in which you can learn about latest research and participate in their activities. We would recommend that you wait for a while before purchasing subscriptions so that you give yourself time to know what your own interests are because these subscriptions are not for free.<br>
<br><br>
<img src="ieee7.png"><br><br><br>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Step 9</p>
If you still want to purchase subscriptions click on the community you want to be a part of and tick the checkbox for purchase of the subscription and tick check boxes containing the things you want to buy.<br>
    The expenses will be added to the cart of your membership fee. You can otherwise join societies later if you want to. There may even be special offers that may provide subscriptions for free if you wait for joining societies.<br><br><br>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Step 10</p>
Now you will be asked about being in IEEE directories. I would recommend yes since it gives you access to IEEE collaboratec which can help you interact with other people around the world in IEEE.<br>
      Then fill out your interest and for " tell us about how you heard of IEEE" <br>
        <br>

<br><br><br>
<p style="font-size: 30px;">Step 11</p>
You can make the payment by credit card on your own or you can pay the money to Sharmila mam at her office in IT department. She is the faculty in charge for IEEE at SSN.
<br>
      Membership alone will be 27 USD which is around 2000 rupees. If you are buying subscriptions the cost will be added to the membership fee and make sure to pay that as well if you are paying through Sharmila Mam. 
<br><br>
<img src="ieee9.png">
<br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 30px;">Step 12</p>
Once the payment process is complete you will receive a set of instructions or mails from IEEE. Then you will be given your membership number. This will complete the membership process and enroll in SSN IEEE SB <a href="enroll.php">here.</a><br>
